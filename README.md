## Hillfinder

Essentially this an progressive web app which allows the user to map a route to a destination on a decline!

Currently it's in its infancy and haven't touched any of the integration of any geolocation API's, as I wanted to take the opportunity to get better aquainted or straight up learn some new tech as I built it!

I am using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and at (Semantic-UI-React)[https://react.semantic-ui.com/]
